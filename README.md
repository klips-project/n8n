# n8n workflows

This repository contains the workflows available for [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

After initializing the project [klips-project/rabbitmq-n8n](https://github.com/klips-project/rabbitmq-n8n) or another n8n environment, these files can be imported there and used with the workers provided in [klips-project/rabbitmq-worker](https://github.com/klips-project/rabbitmq-worker).
